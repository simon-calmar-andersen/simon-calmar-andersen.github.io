I am a Professor at Department of Political Science, Aarhus University. I study education policy from various perspectives. Together with good collageues I study the effects of how teaching is organized (What is the effect of increasing [instruction time](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1516686113) or having an [extra teacher](https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvy048) in the classroom?). We study study the effect of schools' collaboration with parents (What is the effect of involving parents in [shared-book reading](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1607946113) and how does such involvement influence [parents' feedback to the political system](https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12360)?). We have examined the effects of performance information (What is the effect of providing teacher and parents with [information on student test results](https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muz036) and of [performance management in public schools](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9299.2008.00717.x) and in [private schools](https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/mut019)?)
