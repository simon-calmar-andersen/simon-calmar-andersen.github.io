I am a Professor at Department of Political Science, Aarhus University and Director of TrygFonden's Centre for Child Research, also at Aarhus University, Denmark. Together with good colleagues from multiple disciplines (political science, economics, psychology), I study education policy from various perspectives. 

**The organization of teaching** 

* What are the effects of increasing [instruction time](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1516686113)?

* or having an [extra teacher](https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvy048) in the classroom? 

**Collaboration with parents** 

* What is the effect of involving parents in [shared-book reading](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1607946113)?

* and how does such involvement influence [parents' feedback to the political system](https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12360)?

**Performance information** 

* What is the effect of providing teacher and parents with [information on student test results](https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muz036) 
* What are the effects of [performance management in public schools](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9299.2008.00717.x) 
* and in [private schools](https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/mut019)?

**Minority students**

* How are students with [minority background met by the schools](https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/mux006)?

* How can [negative attitudes be reduced](https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muy083)?

* and what is the effect of an [asset-based approach to first language instruction](https://rdcu.be/czIQi)?

**Implementation of school interventions**

* How can schools be [nudged to implement](https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muaa022) new programs?

* and how can evidence-based programs be [scaled up](https://hceconomics.uchicago.edu/research/working-paper/implementing-educational-interventions-scale)?

**Socio-emotional skills**

* How do parental education relate to educational achievements and socio-emotional skills among [biological and adopted childen](https://doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000314)?

* and how do [socio-emotional skills related to academic skills](https://doi.org/10.1111/jopy.12538)?
